# Entry nº3: 16/09/2024

As my father worked for Microsoft, one of the perks he got was a big discount on an Xbox 360, the big chunky one
 with 120 GB of storage. I grew up playing games like Halo 3 and 4, Forza Motorsports 4 and Viva Piñata.

The other day I was feeling nostalgic and when I tried to boot up Forza, with the disc, I ran into the "Open Tray"
 error. The error consists on when you basically try to start a game with a disc and the Xbox displays a "Reading.."
 signal, you can hear the motors trying to spin the disc but unsuccessfully, returning back to the "Open Tray" signal, as if there was no disc inside.

When troubleshooting throught the Internet, the common solutions I found were:
 - Pushing the laser to it's initial position, closer to the center of the disc. Some of the lasers were 'out of bounds' of the disc and so it couldn't be read.
 - Cleaning the dust out of the system, it's unprobable that it'll solve it but dust is never good, so I cleaned it.
 - Gently cleaning the laser lense with a q-tip and isopropyl alcohol, the lense may be ditry and unable to clearly read the disc.
 - Adjusting the DVD and CD plots in the laser to reduce the resistance and increase it's power.

 I started by searching how to open the system and used [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XCT1SqFlFg). Since I only had to take out like 6 screws through the whole process, everything else is held together by clamps, brittle shitty clamps, and so I recommend aquiring [this tool](https://www.ifixit.com/products/xbox-360-opening-tool) that really makes your life easier.

I ran throught the list but none of them solved the issue. I think I might have done the last one incorrectly but
 I'll give it another go, another time. If that doesn't work, I'll try to replace the laser, just like the Ps2 Slim issue that I had on the previous entry.

## Lessons Learned:
 - Clamps suck
 - Sometimes you won't be able to fix it at first, but don't quit.
