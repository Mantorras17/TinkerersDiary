I've had a Nintendo DS for probably 15 years now and since then, the turn on button was having some bad 
 contact and the L and R triggers were too. Not only that, but when trying to turn on the device, it turned on but 
 quickly off, even with a full battery charge.

Started by opening up the device, with extreme care so that no component would be ruined. The Nintendo DS Lite is
 quite small for a device with 2 screens, a touchpad, two fairly good speakers, a microphone, a Wi-Fi antenna, an LED light, a really durable battery and all the buttens, so like for any small device, it was a bit of a challenge to separate all of them. The most challenging part was separating the top screen from it's plastic case, because the ribbon cable that connects to the motherboard in the lower half of the device accompanies you throughought the whole dismanteling. Although with the frightning possibility of ruining my device, as an inexperienced tinkerer, I managed to push through with the help of a few [Youtube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bfow_e5AhpE&pp=ygUjbmludGVuZG8gZHMgbGl0ZSBzY3JlZW4gcmVwbGFjZW1lbnQ%3D).

I used a working Nintendo DS I borrowed from my sister, and by swapping my motherboard with hers I realised that
 the issues lied within my screens. My next step was figuring out if it was my top or bottom screen. With some more
 swapping between screens, I discovered that there was issues with both of the screens, to this day I'm not sure what the issue was or the cause.

From there, I thought about buying only the screens from Amazon, Ebay or Ali Express but upon considering prices
 and the risk of having to buy some other component, I ended up buying a used yet working Nintendo DS Lite from a small Ebay shop. The damage came out to be around 50€.

The package took only a week to arrive and when it did, I got to work. I started by cleaning all the components
 from both devices, since it had been a while between phases of this project, and then swapped the screens around and *voilà*! It worked! I ended up mixing the cases from both nintendos to make a Red/White and a White/Red Nintendo DS Lite (outside/inside), like the pictures show.

In the end, I powered on the supposedly non-functioning Nintendo and it surprisingly **turned on**!? I don't know
 what happened honestly it should't have worked for both. My theses is that I poorly connected a ribbon cable while troubleshooting and it caused it to bug out. That might even had been the problem from the get go, just repeated errors while testing. Oh well, I just know that 2 is better than none.

## Lessons Learned:
 - Ribbon cables suck
 - Nostalgia is expensive (around "50 bucks" expensive)
 - It's quite fun to dismantle electronics yet quite stressfull because I cannot mess up
