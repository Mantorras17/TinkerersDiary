My parents bought me and my sisters a PS2 Slim about 18 years ago and when I tried to boot it the other day, it  
 wouldn't read some of the games we had, but some others did. My father said "Oh that's obviously because the disks are all scratched up" but I didn't think so.

With some troubleshooting, I found out that the only difference between the working disks and the others was that
 the former were CDs and the latter were DVDs. I searched it up to see if it was a common issue and indeed it was!
 I found this [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpBcizXqPZA&pp=ygUYcHMyIHNsaW0gd29udCByZWFkIGRpc2Nz) that helped me throughout the repair.

The main fix was that I had to replace the laser of the PS2 so I bought it through Amazon. I started by opening up and 
 cleaning up just the main part to see what the challenges would be, as the new laser was in delivery. The laser came out to be around 30€.

The most challenging part of this repair was that I had to solder a solder blob from the new laser that protected a
 smaller component during shipment. The problem you may ask? Well, I'd never soldered before. With the help of my father, we grabbed an old circuit board from a printer and got to soldering. We only had a soldering iron without the controlling station and a copper mesh to remove the solder from the iron, but that was more than enough to remove those tiny components, like LED lights, a few buttons, resistances (which are the worst if you want to preserve them, very fragile), and transistors. That served as a good enough training for the test ahead.

When the new laser arrived, I started by dismantling the device again and cleaning it with isopropyl alcohol. Then,
 I removed the old laser and got to preparing the other one. I set it up nicely, heated up the soldering iron placed some flux on the solder blob, and gently heated it, removing it with the soldering iron. It was a success!
 Then the rest was easy, simply reversed the process and mounted it back together again just like new. I ended up skipping a step of adding new lithium grease to the mechanics of the laser because I had none and vaseline, being composed of petrol, would eat away the plastics of the PS2.

The testing phase was stressful though. I started by testing the CDs, the ones that worked before, and the results 
 were as if I put a DVD on them... I was very confused. I proceeded to insert a DVD and it goddamn worked! I was very proud of myself because I could now play all the cool games we used to play. I don't know why the CDs are not working now but I don't think I want to find out, since the only CDs we have are Baby the Pig and like a WW2 invasion plane type game. I don't think it's worth my time. I CAN NOW PLAY SHREK 2 AND JUNGLE PARTY!

## Lessons Learned:
 - The PS2 Slim was way easier to tear apart than the Nintendo DS Lite
 - I learned the basics of soldering, but I still have a lot left to learn
