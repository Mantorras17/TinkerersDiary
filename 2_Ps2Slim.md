My parents bought me and my sisters a PS2 Slim like 18 years ago and when I tried to boot it the other day, it  
 wouldn't read some of the games we had, but some others it did. My father said "oh that's obviously because the disks are all scrached up" but I didn't think so.

With some trouble shooting, I found out that the only difference from the working disks and the others were that
 the former were CD's and the latter were DVD's. I searched it up to see if it was a common issue and indeed it was!
 I found this [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpBcizXqPZA&pp=ygUYcHMyIHNsaW0gd29udCByZWFkIGRpc2Nz) that helped me throughout the repair.

The main fix was that I had to replace the laser of the PS2, so that I did. Started by opneing up and cleaned up
 just the main part to see what would the challenges be, as the new laser was in delivery. The laser came out to be around 30â‚¬.

The most challenging part of this repair was that I had to solder a solder blob from the new laser that protected a
 smaller component during shippment. The problem you may ask? Well I'd never soldered before. With the help of my father, we grabbed an old circuit board from a printer and got to soldering. We only had a soldering iron without the controlling station and a copper mesh to remove the solder from the iron, but that was more than enough to remove those tiny components, like LED lights, a few buttons, resistances (which are the worst if you want preserve them, very fragile), and transistors. That served as a good enough training for the test ahead.

When the new laser arrived, i started by dismantling the device again and cleaning it with isopropyl alchool. Then,
 I removed the old laser and got to preparing the other one. I set it up nicely, heated up the soldering iron placed some flux on the solder blob and gently heated it up, removing it with the soldering iron. It was a success!
 Then the rest was easy, simply reversed the process and mounted it back together again just like new.

The testing phase was stressful though. I started by testing the CD's, the ones that worked before, and the results 
 were as if I put a DVD on it.. I was very confused. I proceded to insert a DVD and it goddamn worked! I was very proud of myself because I could now play all the cool games we used to play. I don't know why the CD's are not working now but I don't think I want to find out, since the only CD's we have is Baby the pig and like a WW2 invasion plane type game. I don't think it's worth my time. I CAN NOW PLAY SHREK 2 AND PARTY IN THE JUNGLE

## Lessons Learned:
 - The PS2 Slim was way easier to tear appart than the Nintendo DS Lite
 - I learned the basics of soldering, but I still have a lot left to learn
